remind on the very American ideal of working rights as human rights as human rights .
the Congressors of Keith Ellison and John Lewis have a legislative proposal to establish a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions .
`` Ellion , &apos;&apos; said the Central Caucus , &apos;&apos; said Ellison , &apos;&apos; said Ellison , a Democrat from Minnesota and Ellion .
therefore , I urge jointly with the Ombudsman Lewis .
the same opinion of the workers are the same legal opportunities for discrimination , because of the organisation of trade unions such as other forms of discrimination and stopped forces .
the completion of national labour legislation in order to create a discrimination for discrimination of workers to the organisation of a trade official representation in order to create justice - and to prevent justice - is an sense of justice - is a useful and necessary initiative .
but there is no radical initiative - in any case not after American standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what Ellison , Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal , which is a very American idea .
despite the backs that trade uniunions in Wisconsation , Michigan and other states , Michigan and other countries in the whole of Americans in all over the world .
it was a time to remind of millions of Americans , as this country of democracy , freedom , freedom , and freedom of the United States .
as the United States , after the Second World War Douglas Mac Arthur , and his state of the country to make a constitution of the country to ensure that the militarthur , ensure that the militarthur &apos;s militarthur by democracy .
in full knowledge of the fact that workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan an an role , they use a language that ` the rights of workers &apos; rights of workers &apos; rights and trade unions .
as the United States , after the Second World War , the David Eishower and his his his government would be the Deutsche , a Constitution , a constitution , a constitution to ensure that the Faschism would be replaced by a strong democracy .
in accordance with the fact that the workers should organise , and their voice in the new nation , and their voice in the new nation , the Deutsche a Klausel that is explicitly imposed : `` the right to create and to safeguard working and economic conditions and safety and safe .
agreements that right , or restricting this right or to aims , there are null and note ; note measures are unilateral .
as the first of all , Lady Eleananor Roosevelt , the Presidency on the International Human Rights Commission , which was adopted by the general statement of human rights , including 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement was adopted by the United Nations as 1948 by the United Nations .
since generations Americans , Americans have the fundamental rights of human rights .
in other countries , like this country , such as we might be able to deal with civil and democratic society - and democratic society - and that this is the right to focus on the basis of equal partners .
after these rights in America , it is indeed , it is actually very carefully to the American ideal again , according to the labelling population , and in a free and open society .
as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr.
history is a great amount of lessons .
now all that the work movement of the strengths of the nation of the nation is not limited .
the lifting of millions of work on millions of work on wonderful and the entire nation of the entire nation of the entire nation .
those who want to understand the work , forget these simple truths , but the history .
history , and we should do so .
labour rights as human rights - and enlargement of the protection of citizens &apos; rights and enlargement of citizens as protection against discrimination in creation of workers - is long-term .
